# Community detection

Community detection for political groups using tweets of israeli politicians.\
Viewing each of the users as a node, if user u retweets a tweet t, originally posted by user v, we consider it a directed edge from u to v.\
The edge weight is determined by the number of tweets by v that u has retweeted.\
Community detection algorithms:
* Girvanâ€“Newman
* Louvain method
* Clique percolation method

Analyse each algorithm results with Modularity measure.
